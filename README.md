# KR70 Inverse Kinematic Simulation
6DOF Industrial Robot Arm Inverse Kinematic Simulation

This code contains a Kuka KR70 inverse kinematics simulation in Matlab. In the trajectory planning phase, a trajectory is generated and sampled in the workspace. Inverse kinematic solutions for the sampled position and orientation of the robot's axes have been computed. Additionally, linear trajectory planning has been performed in the robot's joint space.
